            <h1>7 Endangered Languages and Where They Are</h1>

            <p>Here is some more general information about endangered languages, if you are curious and want to learn more!</p>
            <br>

            <h3>What are endangered languages exactly?</h3>

            <p>There are estimated to be over 7,100 languages spoken in the world today!
            However, the world's top 20 spoken languages are the native tongue of over 3.7 billion people total, 
            meaning that 0.3% of the world's languages account for almost half of the world population.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, there are estimated to be almost 3,200 endangered languages, which is about 44% of all languages, 
            and often there are under 1,000 speakers remaining.</p>

            <p>Languages may become endangered when its users begin to pass on a more dominant language to the subsequent generations, 
            as children may still understand their parents' language but cannot speak it fluently, making them passive bilinguals, 
            who are unable to pass the language down to their own children.</p>

            <p>Institutional languages are least likely to become unstable as they are adopted by governments, schools, media, etc, 
            and are also used as second languages.</p>

            <p>However, there are also likely many languages which we do not know of the existence of, 
            as some cultures may avoid outside contact with the rest of the world.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>So what? Why do they matter?</h3>

            <p>The benefit of having so many diverse languages is that we get to experience all these different cultures, 
            to only have one spoken language would be to erase so many unique cultural identities and reduce expression.</p>

            <p>And even if everyone were to speak the same language, languages and dialects naturally branch off into different directions 
            as time passes on to develop more unique ways of communicating.</p>

            <p>As George Steiner said, "When a language dies, a way of understanding the world dies with it, a way of looking at the world."</p>

            <p>Since customs and traditions are passed down through talking/communication, it inextricably links culture to language.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>How do you know if a language is endangered?</h3>
            
            <p>The main criteria for considering whether a language is endangered are:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The current number of living speakers,</li>
                    <li>The mean age of native/fluent speakers, and</li>
                    <li>The percentage of the youngest generation acquiring fluency with the language.</li>
                </ol>

            <p>UNESCO has made a chart of the degree of language endangerment of any given language, which go from grade 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, to 0, 
            with 0 meaning the language has become dormant/extinct. 5 is safe, 4 is unsafe, 3 is definitely endangered, 
            2 is severly endangered, 1 is critically endangered and 0 is extinct.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Is there anything that can be done?</h3>
            
            <p>It seems pretty grim right now, but there are still things that can be done to at least try and combat language endangerment!
            For example, people can:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Give basic linguistic and paedagogical teaching,</li>
                <li>Develop literary and documentation skills sustainably,</li>
                <li>Support/develop national language or education policy, and</li>
                <li>Improve living conditions and respect for the human rights of speaker communities.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Of course, you're not expected to do all these things yourself. 
            Fortunately, there are still many people working on restoration of endangered languages 
            and are making their best attempts to keep languages alive. Some strategies include the 3 Rs which are 
            revitalisation, revival and reclamation, for when languages have completely died. 
            Meanwhile, maintenance is for languages that are endangered and need to be supported</p>
            <br>

            <p>And... that's all for now! I hope this inspired you to think about the endangerment of languages a little bit, 
            as they are a subject near and dear to my heart, and I hope you enjoyed reading!</p>
